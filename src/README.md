# Final Assignment CPP Template  
This template is a simple structure to help you get started with the final project if ever you want to do it in `C++`. The instructions for the assignment remain the same.  

## Structure  
Please follow the documentation and structure example which you can find in the `src/` folder. This means that your main code should go into `IsaSim.cpp` and the other classes or utility code you might write should go into `src` with extensions in `.cpp` for your source code and `.h` for your headers.  
  
## Compiling & Executing  
With the current template, we have suplied a cmake configuration, so to use it:  
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./isasim
```
